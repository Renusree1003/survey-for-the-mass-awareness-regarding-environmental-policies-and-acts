                    <p><span class="hide" style="display: none;">A survey for mass awareness regarding environmental policies and acts is a tool used to gather information from a representative sample of the population to better understand their knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to the environment and its protection. The survey typically includes questions related to environmental policies and regulations, as well as individual actions that can be taken to reduce environmental impact.

The purpose of the survey is to assess the level of public awareness and understanding of environmental policies and their implementation. It can also be used to identify areas where further education and outreach may be needed to improve public understanding and engagement.</span></p>
